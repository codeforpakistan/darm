Disaster and Relief Management System
=====================================

This is a web-based disaster and relief management system, that provides the following features:

**Organization Registry:** A collaborative “Who is doing what, where” tool which enables tracking of the relief organizations and other stakeholders working in the disaster region. It captures information about the places where each organisation is active and the range of services being provided.

## Future Plans

**Missing Person Registry:** An online bulletin board of missing and found people. It captures information about the people missing and found, and also the information of the person seeking them.

**Situation Awareness:** Gives an overview of the event and allows people to add information on what is happening on the ground. It features the ability to plot a note and a photo with additional information on a Map, so that people can collaboratively capture the current disaster situation.

**Shelter Registry:** Keeps track of the location and basic data of shelters in the region. It also provides a geospatial view to plot the location of the camps in the affected area.

**Request/Pledge Management System:** An online repository where all relief organizations, relief workers, government agents and camps can effectively match requests of aid and supplies to pledges of support. It tracks aid provision from request to fulfillment.

**Volunteer coordination:** Helps NGOs keep track of all their volunteers, their contact information, project allocation, availability and skills to help them distribute staff resources.
